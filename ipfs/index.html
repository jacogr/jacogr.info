        <section>Well, this is me. I build stuff.</section>
        <section>Currently I'm spending all my waking/working hours on <a href="https://github.com/polkadot-js" target="_blank">polkadot-js</a>. I prefer to spend time where I can add real value, here I do. I am lucky enough that <a href="https://www.parity.io/" target="_blank">Parity</a> keeps me around and allows me to pursue efforts outside the core as the maintainer for this project.</section>
        <section>When not building, I am an active user of the same interfaces and libraries I have had a hand in developing on <a href="https://kusama.dotapps.io" target="_blank">Kusama</a> and <a href="https://polkadot.dotapps.io" target="_blank">Polkadot</a>. In a certain sense I'm the chief lab-rat for enhancements to improve the experience for both end-users and developers.</section>

          <ul>
            <li>Talking is easy. I prefer letting my actions speak for me.</li>
            <li>I am not a maximalist. Not on the blockchain, not in life.</li>
            <li>In blockchain I am a holder, validator, nominator, developer and employee. In that order.</li>
            <li>In life I am a father, husband and developer. In that order... well, I try.</li>
            <li>I am human. I am not perfect. I make mistakes. I try not to.</li>
          </ul>

        <section>In the decentralized world, we have a lot of work left - sadly I sometimes swear at myself since we are not moving fast enough. And a lot of times I just swear at myself since I am not iterating fast enough. I would love to see:</section>
        <section>Blockchains sharing security and messages; Blockchain governance that is action driven; Linking of decentralized technologies; Stability on Polkadot and risk-taking on Kusama; Making decentralized technologies easy to use for "normal" people; Web3 to grow into the promise it has made.</section>
